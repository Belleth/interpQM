R scripts for the homogenization of snow depth time series

Welcome to interpQM, a tool for homogenization and analysis of daily snow depth time series.

The tool is currently being completely rewritten, the parts will be published here as soon as they are finished and tested.

## Technical details
If you are interested, technical details on the adjustment algorithm and its performance can be found here:
