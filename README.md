# interpQM
R scripts for the homogenization of snow depth time series.

Welcome to interpQM, a tool for homogenization and analysis of daily snow depth time series.

The tool is currently being completely rewritten, the parts will be published here as soon as they are finished and tested. Test-data from the Swiss-Austrian region and a readme-file will follow soon.

## Technical details
Technical details on the adjustment algorithm and its performance can be found here:
